React.js: This is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows developers to create reusable UI components. In your website, it means that the developers have broken down the UI into separate, manageable pieces called components. Each component is likely responsible for a part of the website (e.g., a header, a footer, a form, etc.).

HTML: HyperText Markup Language is the standard language for creating web pages. It structures the content on the web, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and other items.

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets describe how HTML elements are to be displayed on the screen, in print, or in other media. CSS adds styles to the HTML elements, such as colors, fonts, and layout.

Bootstrap: This is a popular CSS framework that helps in designing responsive and mobile-first websites quickly. It includes pre-styled components like buttons, forms, navbars, etc., which makes the development process faster.

Explanation of "separated all components":
In a React.js application, breaking down the UI into separate components is a fundamental practice. Each component encapsulates a part of the user interface and can be reused across different parts of the application. For example, you might have components like Header, Footer, Sidebar, Button, Form, etc. This modular approach makes the code more organized, maintainable, and scalable.

Explanation of "list the pages":
In a website, especially one built with React, there are typically multiple pages, each representing a different route or view within the application. Examples of pages might include Home, About, Contact, Services, etc. In React, you can use a router (like React Router) to navigate between these pages. The router maps URL paths to specific components, which are rendered when a user navigates to those paths.

Summary
React.js: Used for building the user interface with reusable components.
HTML: Provides the structure of the web pages.
CSS: Adds styling to the HTML elements.
Bootstrap: Provides pre-styled components and responsive design capabilities.
Separated components: The UI is divided into manageable, reusable pieces.
Pages: Different views or routes in the application, managed by a routing system.
